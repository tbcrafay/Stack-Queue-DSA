Stack (java.util.Stack)
 * push(E item): Adds an element to the top of the stack.
 * pop(): Removes and returns the element at the top of the stack.
 * peek(): Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it.
 * empty(): Checks if the stack is empty and returns a boolean value (true if empty, false otherwise).
 * search(Object o): Returns an integer representing the 1-based position of the object o in the stack. Returns -1 if the object is not found.


Queue (java.util.Queue)
 * add(E e): Inserts the specified element into this queue. Throws an exception if the element cannot be added due to capacity restrictions.
 * offer(E e): Inserts the specified element into this queue if possible. Returns true upon success and false on failure.
 * remove(): Retrieves and removes the head of this queue. Throws an exception if the queue is empty.
 * poll(): Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, or returns null if this queue is empty.
 * peek(): Retrieves, but does not remove, the head of this queue. Returns null if this queue is empty.
Note: These are the most common and essential operations for Stack and Queue in Java.
I hope this clarifies the built-in operations for these data structures!
